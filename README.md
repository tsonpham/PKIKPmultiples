Dr. Thanh-Son Pham, November 2022

Open source code for observations of PKIKP multiples in direct wavefield.

The content of this repository include:
- MAIN.ipynb: contains programs to construct global stacks and measurement of differential residual travel time of PKIKP multiple pairs.
- BulkIC_model_refs.csv and IMIC_model_refs.csv contain refereces corresponding to the two specific IC models.
- PKIKP_multiple_dataset.csv: residual travel time measurements for 16 high-quality events.
